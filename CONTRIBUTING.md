## Developing guidelines

- If CRDs in `deploy/crds` are updated, the same file names located in `deploy/olm-catalog/ibm-block-csi-operator` must be updated accordingly.
- If `role.yaml`, `role_binding.yaml`, or `operator.yaml` in `deploy` are updated, the ClusterServiceVersion(CSV) file in `deploy/olm-catalog/ibm-block-csi-operator` must be updated accordingly.
- If `README.md` is updated, ClusterServiceVersion(CSV) file in `deploy/olm-catalog/ibm-block-csi-operator` must be updated accordingly.
- Run `operator-sdk add` to add a new API or controller, for more details, please refer to https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk.
- Run `operator-sdk generate k8s` and `operator-sdk generate openapi` after you change something in `pkg/apis`.
